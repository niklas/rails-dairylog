# Rails::Dairylog

Do you hate the standard Rails logging format?


              Not enough milk?


              I have a solution:


              _       _            _
           __| | __ _(_)_ __ _   _| | ___   __ _  __ _  ___ _ __
          / _` |/ _` | | '__| | | | |/ _ \ / _` |/ _` |/ _ \ '__|
         | (_| | (_| | | |  | |_| | | (_) | (_| | (_| |  __/ |
          \__,_|\__,_|_|_|   \__, |_|\___/ \__, |\__, |\___|_|
                             |___/         |___/ |___/


## Installation

Add this line to your Rails application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails-dairylog'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Look at logs. If nothing changes, reflect on your life choices and install `cowsay` by spilling beer on your mac or use a package manager.

If you want more chatter, set `MOO_FACTOR=23` or something.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
